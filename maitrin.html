        This one I am particularly proud and passionate about since it allowed me to make positive difference not only in my personal life, but, people’s lives as well. <br/><br/>

<strong>Motivation behind this project: </strong>Until the birth of maitrin.com, no such platform in Marathi language (Indian regional language) existed that was solely for women empowerment and served the necessity of the support group. Even today a large number of Marathi women don’t access a typical English language social media / support group and thereby left craving for crucial support and the medium that could empower them.  Being an Autism mom, I have a deep empathy towards the people those are in need for a support group as well as access to important information that can make difference in their life. <br/> <br/>

<strong> The offering:</strong>
I founded and developed 'www.maitrin.com' in February of 2015. This regional website (Marathi - my mother-tongue) that is solely built for women empowerment and support, now has about 1150+ verified registered members across the globe and over 20 million page views till date.  It offers following: </p> 

        <ul style="font-size: 20px;"> 
        <li> Distance Learning as part of Maitrin University.  Audio, Video clips as well as blogs from various contributors across the globe offering education and information on various topics like finance, health, hobbies etc.  </li>
        <li> Nodes / Discussions on current news / events or specific topics of discussion like health, travel, finance,   etc.  Members contributing and helping from all around the world including SMEs in fields like Artificial Intelligence, CEOs or Celebrity Henna Artists. </li>
        <li> Support groups, Social Media and Keeping up with Friends.
 </li>
        <li> Online cultural /fun events as well as in person meet ups throughout the year organized by Maitrin admin team
</li>   
    </ul>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">
<strong>Technology powering maitrin:
Drupal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery PHP, MySQL, phpMyadmin, cPanel, secure ssl <br/>
Hosted on: Hostgator </strong> <br/> <br/>

<strong> Near term roadmap and technology options:</strong>  </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;"> 
        <li> Ability to locate maitrin user by location or function e.g. doctor or lawyer in a user friendly manner.  Use of node.js and react as well as google maps API to build this app.</li>
            <li>Core Drupal upgrades </li>
        </ul>
